This POC tests the react native color picker and if it does what I would like (pick a theme color):

https://github.com/instea/react-native-color-picker

However this looks deprecated, there are issues with Slider. A good example of a POC that proves that maybe it's a good idea not to use it.

I'm gonna try and use react-native-wheel-color-picker instead. Because I DO want the slider, and the whole point of using an external package is it does its job!
